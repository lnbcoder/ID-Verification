Java Taks

Sipho is a Software Developer at the Department of Home Affairs (DHA). He is working under the supervision of Ms Baloyi, a senior developer at DHA. 
As his first task, Ms Baloyi gives Sipho an opportunity of participating in the Identification Document (ID) Verification Project (ID-VP).
The task given to Sipho is to develop a web application that will determine whether a given ID is valid or not. The criteria for a valid ID is based on the ID number.
So the SA ID has the following features:
• It is 13 digits long.
• The first six digits represent the date of birth (YYMMDD).
• The next four digits represent the gender of a person. Females are allocated the the range 0000-4999, and males 5000-9999).
• The next digit denotes citizenship status. The digit 0 denotes one was born a South African citizen, and 2 says the person is a permanent resident.
• The 12th digit is no longer used.
• The 13th is used to verify an ID using Luhn's algorithm.
